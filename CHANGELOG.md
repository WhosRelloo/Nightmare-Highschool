# Changelog: Nightmare Highschool

All notable changes to the NH Combat Test dev place. The newest entries come first.

## [UI 1.2] - 2026-10-30: Playtest pass

### Changed
- The DOWNED alert's subtitle and countdown are larger.
- The posture meter label is larger and readable.

### Verified in a live playtest, with real key presses
- **Hotbar:** 1 equips your tool (the slot glows gold); pressing 1 again unequips it.
- **Dialogue:**
  - E on Pip opens the compact box (464×149 px on a 600 px-tall window), and the bottom HUD hides.
  - 2 picks a reply and closes it, and the HUD returns.
  - Number keys don't fire the hotbar while you're talking.
- **Yen** updates live (¥327 → ¥347 from a quest reward).
- **Interaction prompt** renders as the engraved E key cap with "Pip Larkin / Talk".
- **Clock** ends above the quest tracker.
- **Console:** no UI errors.

## [UI 1.1] - 2026-10-30: Quest UI polish

### Changed
- **Quest tracker:**
  - The card and the stealth detection meter use the same ornate chip as the clock.
  - The detection bar is an iron-framed meter.
  - The objective marker is an engraved gold plate.
- **Quest journal:** quest, clue and insight blocks are bracket-cornered kit cards. A picked clue gets a gold frame and a warm fill instead of a flat colour, and hovering a clue lights its frame.
- **Clock HUD** now scales with the screen like the quest tracker, so the tracker card always sits below it.

### Fixed
- Auto-sized kit cards no longer have an empty band underneath. The clock panel now matches its text exactly.

### Verified
- **In a live playtest:** the new HUD (health, hotbar, Yen, posture meter, DOWNED alert), all 30 prompts switched to the custom style, the core health and backpack hidden, and the clock fitting its text.

## [UI 1.0] - 2026-10-30: "After Dark" UI overhaul

### Added
- **NH UI kit** (`ReplicatedStorage.UI`): a shared Theme plus Components builders for:
  - panels, tabs, buttons, toggles, sliders and keybind rows
  - item slots and grids, search, stat sheet, danger alert, player list and dialogue
  - health bar, hotbar and meters, toasts, choice rows and bars
  - server rows and browser, character preview and credits
- **Original gothic art** with PBR lighting baked into every texture: iron-gate arcade borders, chalk-smudged slate, wax-seal rarity gems, a cracked skull-bell, a clock-face health orb, and candle, blood-drop, quill and cross icons.
- **In-play HUD** (`Controllers.Gui.KitHud`):
  - a health bar with a % orb, plus a delayed "ghost" segment showing recent damage
  - a hotbar built from your Backpack tools: click, tap or press 1-9
  - live Yen
  - a posture meter
  - a DOWNED alert with the get-up countdown
- **Gothic interaction prompts** (`Controllers.Gui.PromptUi`): an engraved [E] key cap that fills with candle-gold while you hold, plus the object and action text. Touch players hold the key cap.
- **Server selection screen**:
  - a live campus list: a MemoryStore heartbeat, refreshing every 8 s, with Join and Quick Join
  - an in-game period and faction crest on each server
  - a character preview that mirrors your actual character and updates live
- **UI previews** in StarterGui. They're saved disabled and never show in a real game.

### Changed
- **NPC dialogue:**
  - The box is smaller and sits lower, so it no longer covers the view.
  - The ornate frame takes the speaker's faction colour, and replies are numbered rows.
  - The box scales down on short screens.
- **Notifications** are engraved toasts with a wax seal coloured by type.
- **Clock HUD** is an ornate chip, and the class waypoint is an engraved plate.
- **Downed prompt** is an engraved plate above the health bar. It turns red when you're downed or gripped.
- **Factions panel (P):**
  - an ornate panel with a "Who's Who After Dark" plaque
  - bracket-cornered faction cards and iron progress bars
  - kit buttons for the toggle, close and titles
- **Class lessons:** the chalkboard has an iron ornament frame over a slate-green board, replacing the wood border.
- The Roblox **core health bar and backpack hotbar** are replaced by the new HUD. The HUD hides during dialogue and lessons, and number keys are ignored then.

### Fixed
- Leaving a lesson no longer turns the core backpack back on when the new hotbar is active.
- Ornate frames on auto-sized UI no longer stretch to fill the screen.

### Known issues / next
- Posture isn't sent to the client yet, so the meter stays empty until combat sets a `Posture` attribute.
- The quest tracker and quest journal aren't reskinned yet; that waits until the quest work settles.
- The flash, damage-tint and vignette screen effects are unchanged on purpose.
- "Last joined" on the server screen needs saved data.
- The credits list uses placeholder names.
- Still to check in a full playtest: the HUD, prompts and new dialogue size in live play, touch on a real phone, and server teleports (which only run in a published game).
